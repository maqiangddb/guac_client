 About this README
------------------------------------------------------------

This README is intended to provide quick and to-the-point documentation for
technical users intending to compile parts of Guacamole themselves.

Distribution-specific packages are available from the files section of the main
project page:
 
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/guacamole/files/

Distribution-specific documentation is provided on the Guacamole wiki:

    http://guac-dev.org/

 What is guacamole-common?
------------------------------------------------------------

guacamole-common is the core Java library used by the Guacamole web
application.

guacamole-common provides abstract means of connecting to guacd, interfacing
with the JavaScript client and tunnel provided by guacamole-common-js, and
reading configuration from a standard location (guacamole.properties).


------------------------------------------------------------
 Compiling and installing guacamole-common
------------------------------------------------------------

guacamole-common is built using Maven. Building guacamole-common
compiles all classes and packages them into a redistributable .jar file. This
.jar file can be easily included in other Maven-based projects (like Guacamole).

Note that prebuilt versions of guacamole-common are available from the
main guac-dev.org Maven repository which is referenced in all Maven
projects in Guacamole. Unless you want to make changes to guacamole-common
or you want to use a newer, unreleased version (such as the unstable branch),
you do not need to build this manually. You can let Maven download it for
you when you build Guacamole.

1) Run mvn package

    $ mvn package

    Maven will download any needed dependencies for building the .jar file.
    Once all dependencies have been downloaded, the .jar file will be
    created in the target/ subdirectory of the current directory.

2) Run mvn install

    $ mvn install

    DO NOT RUN THIS AS ROOT!

    Maven will install guacamole-common to your user's local Maven
    repository where it can be used in future builds. It will not install
    into a system-wide repository and does not require root privileges.

    Once installed, building other Maven projects that depend on
    guacamole-common (such as Guacamole) will be possible.
